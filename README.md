# OneM7GPE5.1_KaliKernel
Stock 5.1 kernel for the HTC One GPE, with magic.

It's a completely stock kernel but it has already had the 802.11 patch applied and has had its configuration changed so that it loads drivers for the Atheros and Realtek WiFi chipsets. It also has RTL SDR, external Bluetooth and Ethernet drivers - basically the things you'd expect.

This kernel does have the HID Keyboard Gadget patch applied but it does not work due to HTC messing about with how the Gadget Driver works. I tried multiple ways for force the USB mode to include `hid` but I haven't had any success. Thank you @BlinkyBear for helping out with that. Curse you HTC for pissing around. This is all I have to go by for the reason why the gadget is unoperable: https://github.com/pelya/android-keyboard-gadget/issues/43

#Compiling.

This cannot be compiled on Windows. I recommend using Ubuntu 15 64BIT. The script will automatically download the required dependencies, assuming that you are using a Debian-Based Linux Disto (such as Ubuntu). The script can be adapted to work with other devices. I DO NOT provide any means of technical support and neither do I take responsibility for whatever the outcome that may occur when you fiddle around with this and your device.

    bash ./build.sh

By default the script uses 4 cores for compiling the source code but you can edit it to use more or less. Edit the line with `make -j4`
